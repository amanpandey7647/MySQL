A.	Display the number of students in each department
```
SELECT Stud_Dept, COUNT(*) AS Num_Students FROM student GROUP BY Stud_Dept;
```


B.	Find the total marks obtained by students in each department


```
SELECT Stud_Dept, SUM(Marks) AS Total_Marks FROM student
```
```
JOIN marks ON student.Stud_Rollno = marks.Student_Rollno GROUP BY Stud_Dept;
```


C.	List departments with more than 3 students. SELECT Stud_Dept, COUNT(*) AS Num_Students FROM student


```
GROUP BY Stud_Dept HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
```
D.	Find the average percentage of students in each department and sort it in descending order.
```
SELECT Stud_Dept, AVG(Percentage) AS Avg_Percentage FROM student
```

```
JOIN marks ON student.Stud_Rollno = marks.Student_Rollno GROUP BY Stud_Dept
```

```
ORDER BY Avg_Percentage DESC;
```



E.List all students who scored marks between 60 and 80.
```
SELECT Student_Rollno FROM Marks
```

```
WHERE Marks BETWEEN 60 AND 80;
```

[Displays only the roll number of the student]

```
SELECT s.Stud_Name, m.Marks FROM student s
```

```
JOIN marks m ON s.Stud_Rollno = m.Student_Rollno WHERE m.Marks BETWEEN 60 AND 80;
```

[Displays the Name of the student]


F.	Display names of students who belong to selected departments
```
SELECT Stud_Name FROM student
```
```
WHERE Stud_Dept IN ('Computer Science', 'Mechanical Engineering', 'Information Technology');
```


G.	Find students whose names end with 'n'.
